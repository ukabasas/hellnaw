## What is Nova3D?

Nova3D generates 3D assets as **executable construction procedures**. The pipeline writes Blender-native Python scripts, returning a structured GLB with named, separately addressable parts.

This is architecturally different from diffusion-based generators (Meshy, Tripo, Rodin), which extract a single merged mesh with no part boundaries, and from OpenSCAD-based systems (CADAM), which guarantee manifold solids but have a hard ceiling on organic shapes, hierarchy, materials, and structural editability. 

Nova3D uses Blender's scene graph as the native representation - the most expressive geometry substrate available - making it a strict superset of both approaches.

This repo is the client. It connects to our (currently) closed-source hosted service.

## Quick Start

Get the UI running locally in under 2 minutes. Requires [Flutter 3.24+](https://flutter.dev).

```bash
# 1. Clone and Install
git clone https://github.com
cd Nova3D
flutter pub get

# 2. Run Local UI
# Note: Port 5555 is required for OAuth redirect authorization
flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname 0.0.0.0 --web-port 5555
```

1.  Open `http://127.0.0.1:5555`
2.  Sign in (Google/Email).
3.  **Settings** → Add your API Key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini).
4.  Enter a prompt and generate.

## Technical Philosophy

### 1. Script-Native vs. Mesh-Native
Most AI 3D generators use "Image-to-3D" diffusion. Nova3D is "Prompt-to-Code" or "Image-to-Code." And by targeting Blender's API, the following is achieved:
*   **Logical Hierarchy:** Parts are named and parented correctly.
*   **Surgical Edits:** Change the "handle" without regenerating the "cup."
*   **Material Support:** Proper PBR texture mapping rather than "baked" vertex colors.

### 2. Model Agnostic
Nova3D is a generation harness. You can swap between Claude 3.5, GPT-4o, or Gemini 1.5 Pro via the settings menu. The pipeline handles validation and execution regardless of which LLM is writing the code.

### 3. Precision + Organic Flow
Unlike pure CSG/OpenSCAD systems which struggle with organic shapes, Nova3D leverages Blender's full suite of modifiers (subdivision, sculpting, booleans) to create high-fidelity models.

## Features

*   **Integrated Viewport:** Built-in Three.js editor with transform tools, snapping, and material editing.
*   **Local Caching:** Models are cached in-browser; view your history even after remote URLs expire.
*   **Reference Images:** Attach a photo to guide the spatial logic of the generated script.
*   **Production Build:** `flutter build web --release` for static hosting.

---

## Troubleshooting

*   **Auth Loops:** Always use `http://127.0.0.1:5555`. Using `localhost:5555` will cause Google Sign-In to fail due to strict OAuth origin policies.
*   **Self-Hosting Backend:** By default, this client communicates with the `nova3d.xyz` API. To point to a custom backend, use:
    `--dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://your-api.com`
